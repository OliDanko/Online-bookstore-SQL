📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project

This project showcases an SQL-based Online Bookstore Database built entirely in PostgreSQL.
It demonstrates the full workflow of a data analyst – from database design and data loading, through relational queries and aggregations, to business insights generation.

🗄 Database Preparation

The database is built in PostgreSQL and consists of 3 main tables:

✅ Books → book details (title, author, genre, price, stock)  
✅ Customers → customer details (name, city, country)  
✅ Orders → transactional data (order date, quantity, total amount)  

➡ Result: a clean, relational database ready for SQL queries and analysis.  

📌 Project Features  

✅ Relational Schema → 3 connected tables (Books, Customers, Orders)  
✅ SQL Queries → from beginner-friendly to advanced analytics  
✅ Aggregations → SUM, COUNT, AVG for business KPIs  
✅ Joins → combining data across multiple tables  
✅ Filtering & Sorting → business-ready insights  
✅ Business Scenarios → sales trends, customer behavior, inventory tracking
